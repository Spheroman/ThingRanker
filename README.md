# ThingRanker
Rank things using a pairwise competition with Glicko-2
## Database
So the app has 1 preset table and will make more tables as they are needed. Here's an explanation of them: <br> <br>
comps table: 
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>id</td><td>name</td><td>time</td><td>updated</td><td>started</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>unique string of random lowercase letters and numbers. 6 digits long.</td>
    <td>name of the competition</td>
    <td>time the competition was created</td>
    <td>last time the competition was modified in any way</td>
    <td>if the competition is running or not</td>
  </tr>
</table>

Then for every entry in the comps table, theres a new table with name `id`, where `id` is the id from the comps table.
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>id</td><td>name</td><td>rating</td><td>confidence</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>an auto incrementing integer starting at 1</td>
    <td>name of the entry in the competition</td>
    <td>Glicko-2 rating. default 1000</td>
    <td>Glicko-2 confidence. default 500</td>
  </tr>
</table>

We also have a head2head table where we store the results of the pairings, as well as the upcoming pairings. its title is `id_h2h` where `id` is (you guessed it) the id
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>id</td><td>p1</td><td>p2</td><td>winner</td><td>player</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>pairing id</td>
    <td>first item</td>
    <td>second item</td>
    <td>winner of the pairing</td>
    <td>submitter's name (optional)</td>
  </tr>
</table>

That's what we have so far.

## Page Layout and Concept

https://www.figma.com/design/fkUNiNu0bEyCh0Jy0L1Cwo/ThingRanker?node-id=0%3A1&t=ywimVgiXGstqoxEx-1

So, there's going to probably be about 5 pages. A home page, a setup page, a competition landing page, a pairing page, and a results page.

### Home Page
This is where we create the competition. Basically there's a a bunch of information about how the pairings work and whatnot and then competition name field. Basically go to a website that has something similar, and imagine that but without any logins or annoying stuff. When we create a new competition, we redirect to the setup page. If we have enough time, we will also add the ability to use a pin or password to lock the setup information to require authentication.
### Setup Page
This is where we will have all the setup options. You can add an item to the competition, choose the ranking system, choose a pairing system, enable people to add items when they're on the landing page or while the competition is running, start, reset, and delete the competition, and whatever else we think might be useful. Once the tournament starts, this page can show a QR code, and most of the options will be locked. If possible, we figure out websockets or submit arrays or some way to submit multiple things at once, otherwise it will be annoying to use.
### Landing Page
The landing page will be where the non-admins see the competition. It can allow them to add items to the competition as well as the ability to see the current items, but not much else. Once the tournament starts, this is where they can be redirected to the pairing page, although we might just make the pairing page override the landing page while the competition runs. Ideally, we can figure out how to automatically refresh or redirect when it's started using websockets. That will be complicated though.
### Pairing Page
Pairings are shown on this page. It will show 2 options, and the user has to pick between the two, and whichever wins will be recorded in the database. Logic will have to be applied to prevent repeated or invalid post requests. It will also store the amount of submissions and can have a minimum and a maximum amount of submissions for it to be considered valid.
### Ranking Page
This page will show the rankings of the items after the competition finishes or halfway through the competition. Doesn't need much else, other than maybe the ability to reset it.

## Dev Setup
To work on the project, you need to install MySql, PHP, and Apache2. Connect PHP to Apache2 and make sure that PDO_MySql is enabled. In Apache2, enabe mod_rewrite.so for the links to work correctly. In MySql, create a database named `test` with username `root` and password `billybob`. Once that's all set up correctly, run the table_setup.sql while logged into the database.
